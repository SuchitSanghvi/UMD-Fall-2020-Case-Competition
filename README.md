# Topic: Analyzing Cardiovascular Disease to Minimize Mortality and Economic Impact

Case Competition was conducted by RH Smith School of Business at UMD with two objectives:
1. Foster team collaboration across MS programs.
2. Foster relationships and mentoring among 1st year students and 2nd year students.

### Data Source: 
Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) cycles 1.1, 2.1 and 3.1 from Statistics Canada.

#### Number of records and variables in each survey cycle:
CCHS 1.1 -
Number of records 130,880 
Number of variables 614

CCHS 2.1 -
Number of records 134,072
Number of variables 1,068

CCHS 3.1 -
Number of records  132,221 
Number of variables 1,284

### Background: 
The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) is a nationwide
cross-sectional survey. This survey gathers health-related data for the Canadian population
12 years of age and over living in the 10 provinces and 3 territories, covering about 97% of
the target population. In this case study, we will use Public Use Microdata Files (PUMF)
from cycles 1.1, 2.1 and 3.1 that contain data collected in years 2000-2001, 2003 and 2005,
respectively. Various measures were taken to protect the confidentiality of the participants
of the survey.

### Research Question:
This case study aims to familiarize analyzing the PUMF version of the
CCHS dataset (combined data from cycles 1.1, 2.1 and 3.1). After first creating the 'anlaytic dataset' (with only appropriate variables and records useful for anlaysis from all survey cycles) and then use that dataset to
estimate crude and adjusted measures of association between osteoarthritis and
self-reported heart diseases.

1. Within Canadian adults (20-64 years of age), is having osteoarthritis associated with
the developing heart disease? 

2. Does the relationship between osteoarthritis and heart disease vary (a) between
participants living in the northern parts of Canada versus those living in the southern
parts, (b) between men and women, (c) by marital status, or (d) by recency of
immigration?

3. Do the results change when missing values (i.e., invalid responses) for the
‘household income’ are imputed? Which assumptions do you have to make to
perform such an analysis?

4. With the information provided in the PUMF, what would be your interpretation of the
analysis results? What are the limitations of this study? What additional information
would be helpful in reaching a more meaningful conclusion?
